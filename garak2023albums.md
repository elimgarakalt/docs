## Album write-ups

### Sleep Token - Take Me Back To Eden
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/sleep-token/take-me-back-to-eden)

This is the weirdest and most left-field record in the bunch, and the single record that absolutely dominated my 2023 listening by an absurd margin. Everything about this band should make me hate them. I don't like anonymous bands, I don't like elaborate masked gimmicks in bands. The music itself is a ludicrous mix of djent, metal, pop, funk, trap that should absolutely not work at all, but somehow does. And it works incredibly well. I could write forever about this album. 2023 was not a good year for me in a lot of ways and this record really helped me through some immensely dark shit. I feel a bond with it for that reason. The lyrics are grim and hopeless, full of anger and frustration. I relate to many of the themes on this one. The drumming is absolutely mind-bending and fresh and interesting to me, something that doesn't happen very often with me is being surprised by a piece of music. These folks have absolutely captivated and confused me beyond belief. I get really excited trying to cop these drum licks in my own playing, and it has opened a lot of creative doors for me. If you listen to nothing else from this list, I would implore you to check this out with an open mind. The first track, "Chokehold," quite literally has had me in a chokehold for months and months. It is very rare and very high praise for me to say that I can't stop listening to something. I hope it grabs you too.

* Take Me Back To Eden

### Jesse Ware - That! Feels Good!
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/jessie-ware/that-feels-good)

This album took me by surprise. I'd vaguely listened to her in the past but not at the album-level of familiarity. I saw lots of folks hyped about this on Mastodon, so I picked it up to hear what the fuss was about. I really enjoyed this record, it's fun and cunty and queer in all the right ways. I've been having a blast playing the bass lines from these tunes on my bass, there is an irresistible danciness to the record.

* Pearls
* Begin Again

### M83 - Fantasy
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/m83/fantasy)

I am a huge M83 fanboi but this record hit JUST right for me this year. His previous effort "Junk" felt like so long ago, and at the time it came out, it didn't really grab me like this one has. I think the paradigm shift in the sound of "Junk" was finally perfected here on "Fantasy." Synth heavy, luscious walls of sound and an always-present hint of melancholy fuse into a record you'd half dance and half cry to given the right situation. Highly recommended.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Sunny Boy
* Dismemberment Bureau
* Amnesia

### Paco Versailes - Young In California
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/paco-versailles/young-in-california2023)

Self-described as "dancemenco", Paco Versailes bring a really fresh and interesting take on foundational disco elements with flamenco guitar flare and lovely multi-part harmonies dance on top. Giving nods to groups like Air, their style of songwriting allows you to stretch your legs and get lost in a vibe that requires a pair of sunglasses and some lotion. There is an ever-present hint of longing in these songs. Almost like they're recording this idealized dream world to exist in, held together by just a thread. These songs are sunny and happy on the surface, but there is a vibe of this being the last party of the summer, and after tonight, everything changes. 

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Soy Gitano
* Entangle
* Love When We Get High
* I Love My Life

### Yves Tumor - Praise A Lord Who Chews Which Does Not Consume; (Or Simply, Hot Between Worlds)
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/yves-tumor/praise-a-lord-who-chews-but-which-does-not-consume-or-simply-hot-between-worlds)

Yves Tumor has always had a unique sound that remains hard to define, and this record is no exception to that. Delicious meaty bass lines, staccato blasts of life and movement, interesting filtered vocals and lyrics and just when you're longing for them, a screaming wall of fuzzed out guitar cacophony to glue it all together. Tumor's ability to blend falsetto into this blown-out mix of electronic/rock/indie/pop adds a soothing element to help guide you through the dense textures of his records. I recommend headphones for this album, there's always some new texture that jumps out at you on repeat listens that really excites me. Far too complex for a single tour.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Meteora Blues
* Heaven Surrounds Us Like A Hood
* In Spite Of War
* Parody

### Protomartyr - Formal Growth In The Desert
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/protomartyr/formal-growth-in-the-desert2023)

This album instantly became a structural wall of 2023 for me. Protomartyr's entrancing mix of post-punk/70s vibes, crisp recording production and meandering and soothing vocal style really grows some wingspan on this release. This album is an amazing triumph and it's too difficult to put into words, so I suggest just playing it and letting it do most of the talking. Grim but hopeful is how I would describe the lyrical content of this record. There is a huge weight to this record, but it's almost counterbalanced in a way with some glimpses of sunlight at the end of a long, dark road. Highly recommended.

### Jungle - Volcano
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/jungle/volcano)

Jungle are back with another house and disco infused dance powerhouse. Extra crispy production, clean powerful bass and drums, party in a box. Just add people. Jungle aren't reinventing the wheel here, leaning heavily into their time-tested blend of sampled soul and disco to create another album of bangers. These songs are often better enjoyed with their music video counterparts. Jungle lean very heavily into the "one-take" video style where everything is just one long continuous take, often with elaborate choreographed group dancing. Heavily curated, but absolutely worth adding to your collection. If you're fans of this, go check out Franc Moody, very similar and both UK based.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* You Ain't No Celebrity
* Back on 74
* Dominoes
* Pretty Little Thing

### King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard: PetroDragonic Apocalypse; or, Dawn of Eternal Night: An Annihilation of Planet Earth and the Beginning of Merciless Damnation
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/kinggizzardandthelizardwizard/petrodragonic-apocalypse-or-dawn-of-eternal-night-an-annihilation-of-planet-earth-and-the-beginning-of-merciless-damnation)

King Gizzard are crazy and prolific. If you're not familiar with them, go check out a writeup somewhere, it's too immense to contain here. KG love to constantly switch up styles on their records, and generally release several full albums in a year's time. This represents their second thrash metal record. I call this a love letter to the thrash genre, it's sort of like what you imagine a good 80s thrash record would have sounded like with better production techniques. Australian powerhouses LG dance through dizzying metal leads and breakdowns galore on this no-frills metal masterpiece. This one scratches a very specific itch, but isn't super accessible to non-metal fans or folks not familiar with the prog nightmares weaved by this band of Aussie mad lads. This one wins a point for the most tedious actual album title of 2023.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Converge
* Witchcraft
* Gila Monster
* Dragon

### FACS - Still Life In Decay
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/facs/still-life-in-decay)

FACS are an incredible band with a really solid catalogue of unsettling gems. The kings of pleasurable discomfort. They are hard to describe sonically, but their sound is a dystopian blend of post punk and art rock with a heavy emphasis on very uneasy and unsettling atmospheres. Their entire sound feels like a familiar bad dream, a liminal space you can't quite put your finger on. The lyrics are opaque and bleak, and the bass lines and drums seem to just exist in a hypnotic trance-like state. This is a gazer album for sure, something you put on to get completely lost in a foreign yet vaguely familiar futurescape. Their music reminds me of a survival horror game where you wander what's left of depleted cities and towns. Very highly recommended if you're looking for a tense, yet cathartic ride.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* When You Say
* Slogan
* New Flag
* Still Life 

### Unknown Mortal Orchestra - V
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/unknown-mortal-orchestra/v)

UMO are back with another incredible release this year. This album has such a meandering and wandering vibe to it, in a good way. Ruban consistently drops really interesting and unique sounding psychedelic and indie compositions. His unique voice and style of playing guitar really give life and intrigue to this record especially. This is kind of a slow burner compared to some of his previous records, but it's absolutely worth the ride. Gorgeous and tragic.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Guilty Pleasures
* Meshuggah
* In The Rear View
* Layla

### Slowdive - everything is alive
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/slowdive/everything-is-alive)

It's fucking Slowdive. And a new 2023 record. That's basically all I need to write here. Shoegaze pioneers dazzle us with a new release that sounds timeless and gorgeous. The second half of this record is absolutely amazing. As highly recommended as they come.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* skin in the game

* the slab
* alife

### Tomb Mold - The Enduring Spirit
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/tomb-mold/the-enduring-spirit)

In a lot of ways for most folks, the least accessible record in this lineup. It's a classic death metal record with some modern twists from Canadian metal heads Tomb Mold. This record is really chaotic and full of iconic death metal patterns. It takes the concept in a different, kind of more prog direction which I am here for in a big way. I like the hybrid of death metal and 70s prog and jazz they've weaved into the basic death metal song structure. This is a dense and heady listen, perhaps a good background album when you need to focus on something more than something you sit and actively listen to at first.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* The Enduring Spirit of Calamity
* The Perfect Memory (Phantasm of Aura)
* Fate's Tangled Thread

### Mayer Hawthorne - For All Time
[Stream this album](https://songwhip.com/mayer-hawthorne/for-all-time)

Neo-soul motown darling Mayer Hawthorne has dropped another album of throwback soul and dance with all the benefits of modern production. These songs are great date night type of material for when you want to set the right mood. This isn't Hawthorne's finest hour by any means, but this is a solid and immensely listenable record that gets out of your way for the most part. Recommended for fans of the motown sound, retro soul and crooners of yesteryear.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* For All Time
* Without You
* The Pool
* On The Floor
