## Album write-ups

### Snarky Puppy - Somni
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/72Tr4gYIAko7djIwgfS4i1)

What a gorgeous record this is. Snarky Puppy never disappoint, but they really stepped up their game on this release. That is in no small part thanks to having the Metropole Orkest joining them. This record sounds absolutely huge, the production is top notch, and there's an immense amount of talent on display here. This is their first major release without Shaun Martin, who sadly died in 2024. His presence is definitely missed, despite being a nearly perfect record.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* As You Are But Not As You Were
* Chimera

### Vulfpeck - Clarity of Cal
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/2yImgiwCG9KZnxzgulVthl)

There is nothing new on this release at all, but that doesn't take away anything from it. Everything you expect from a Vulpeck record is on display, and the live concert video it's taken from is worth a watch as well. There's really not a ton to say otherwise. Great bass lines, great song writing, and overall just a really fun energy. It's short and sweet, and definitely worth a spin.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Big Dipper
* Can You Tell

### Elder - Liminality / Dream State Return
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/1G7EkxmnRQ5kk2uhAoxMro)

This is an EP, so I hesitated for a second to include it, but honestly it's fucking incredible and deserves its place without question. This band has just continued to evolve and get better, despite not really changing their core vibe. I think the production value and the songwriting keep improving release after release. These songs are always a journey, and always worth the trip. This is heavy progressive music with cottony vocals that never gets discordant or boring. I can't recommend this enough. 

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Liminality
* Dream State Return

### Sleep Token - Even In Arcadia
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/1lS7FeRcSUuIGqyg99UGpj)

I usually don't like to rank albums in any kind of order, but let's be honest, this is by far the best record of 2025 for me, and by far the most listened to. Sleep Token scratch such a specific itch that's impossible to describe. As in my 2023 writeup, nothing about this should work. It's gospel-based djent trap with scream vocals and some of the best drumming anywhere in recorded music history. It makes no sense, but it doesn't need to, because it fucking rules. This is my most recommended release of the year. Gorgeous, tragic, impossible to define. Just like me ;) 

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Provider
* Gethesemane
* Infinite Baths

### Franc Moody - Chewing The Fat
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/3trlSAdPTDzZl6nAzzgo5A)

Another super fun release from UK based studio rats Franc Moody. Another dance record full of tasty bass lines, catchy hooks and vocals, and lush production and instrumentation. This picks up directly from where 2022's "Into the Ether" leaves off. They're not re-inventing the wheel by any means here, but why fuck with something that works so well?

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Going Through the Motions
* Pressure Makes Diamonds

### Between the Buried and Me - The Blue Nowhere
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/1F93SHZcX9qaMsI99RDOtF))

FINALLY! BTBAM are back. This was once one of my top progressive metal bands, but their last few releases had felt very phoned in and uninspired to me. This is the record I've been waiting for them to make for the last decade. I think they absolutely crushed it and produced another insane mash-up of genres and styles that defies categorization. Highly recommended if you like intense heavy music.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Door #3
* The Blue Nowhere

### Sophie Ellis-Bextor - Perimenopop
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/3AsH3xPvymtp24ViMjdUz5)

This album surprised me quite a bit. I am not typically a huge pop girlie, but this record is just wall to wall bangers. Great for a night out or when you just feel like dancing at home in the rainbow lights. I always find it so difficult to define what makes a pop record stand out for me, but this album has that in spades. 

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Vertigo
* Stay On Me
* Glamorous

### The Midnight - Syndicate
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/58ZdIUja7imZmFqOSoI6b7)

This album is perfection. The Midnight return with another album full of gorgeous production, lush synths, and soothing vocals to narrate their retro-future synthwave soundscapes. Syndicate is full of longing, hope, and a pinch of sadness mixed in for good measure. Highly recommended for fans of outrun, dream/synth pop, or people who desperately miss the 80s. A neon pink tinted triumph.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Afterglow pt. 1
* Digital Dreams

### Psychedelic Porn Crumpets - Pogo Rodeo
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/3S7VkLHtCTQPcoi2ZaY4TL)

Another relentless release from the prolific Psychedelic Porn Crumpets, the worst-named band in recent memory. The music more than makes up for the silly name. There is not a single new thing under the sun here, but that isn't surprising. These folks have paved a very specific path for themselves, and they've dropped another album full of the same formula that launched them into being one of the frontrunners of the genre. Hang on tight for this white-knuckle cacophony of guitars and distorted vocals. Fans of noisy but melodic punk music will be right at home here. 

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Texas Rangers
* Salsa Verde

### Coheed and Cambria - The Father of Make Believe
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/7vHWOemZcXHOgBud2vsOEc)

The 3rd installment in the Vaxis lineup, within the saga of the Amory Wars, Coheed and Cambria return with another album full of riffs and prog rock mastery. While not the strongest record in the Vaxis trilogy in my opinion, it has a ton of incredible songs on it that make up for the oft-times cheesy ballads that make an appearance here. Incredible production and tone, and a whole double, perhaps triple album full of music. The deluxe version has 4 more Key Entity Extraction movements added to it, which is a massively welcome addition to the already very solid album. 

#### ***Taster tracks***
* The Father of Make Believe
* The Continuum 1: Welcome to FOrever, Mr. Nobody

### Thrice - Horizons/West
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/5ntbH8ZQsmgZELd2zWCRCs)

Thrice return in 2025 with the much-anticipated followup to the Horizons/East record. This is more moody, and I think the better of the two Horizons records ultimately. This record is intense in places, philosophical lyrically, and emotional all the way through. It tackles themes deeper than may appear on first glance, and really cements their place as a band that defies categorization. For people who like to really chew on the lyrics of a song.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Undertow
* The Dark Glow

### SG Lewis - Anemoia
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/3kse3e9XxmIedJb9bfjErH)

Another solid record from SG Lewis. His soft vocals and undeniably catchy dance pop tunes are on full display here again on this record. A solid follow-up to the timeless "times" record, and while this doesn't quite reach those heights, it's a warm blanket of a record. A really good record to toss on at a party to keep the dancing going through the night.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Transition
* Back Of My Mind

### Deftones - private music
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/1gmWnG5TeRj91Tdm2lpEvJ)

Deftones return with another album full of bangers. This is another record in the newer Deftones style, and hard to find much fault with except for maybe some odd sounding midrange in the guitars on some tracks. I've found the vinyl edition has less jarring production overall, not that it's too distracting, but lacks some of the warmth I've come to expect from the guitar section of this band. It's not the best Deftones record, but an absolutely worthy addition to their catalogue. Like most modern Deftones records, it oscillates between dreamy soundscapes and crushing detuned guitars, with the strong vocal performances you've come to expect from Chino.

### Deafheaven - Lonely People With Power
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/5Eh3xMVdGFAUiYwuoPOzXc)

Blackgaze heroes Deafheaven return to form in 2025 with this release. Their last record was extremely polarizing to fans, and I find this record to be a good middle ground between their earlier material, and the aforementioned record. The vocals are certainly back to being way more black metal than "Infinite Granite," but I am really glad they kept some of the softer instrumental bits from that record. Overall an incredibly strong release from a great band that seems to have fans across a huge spectrum. I always find it interesting how many people like this band who otherwise would never listen to other bands in this genre.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Amethyst
* The Garden Route

### SZA - SOS Deluxe: Lana
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/1Q5WON8dw2JFLP5JVQXu1e)

Technically this is a late update to the incredible "SOS" from 2022, here SZA drops 19 new tracks to accompany an already perfect record. Literally every song on the original "SOS" is marked as "liked" in my streaming service, it's an incredibly vulnerable and impactful record for me. The "Lana" edition has some really great tracks that I am surprised were not included in the original release, and a few where I can understand why they were cut. To be clear, there's not a bad song on this record, but some feel like they don't quite fit the overall themes of the original release. I am a huge SZA stan, and I am really happy to be able to include some of her music in my writeups, as I was not writing under this account in 2022 to feature the original release of "SOS." As recommended as they come.

* Saturn
* Shirt
* 30 For 30
* No More Hiding

### FACS - Wish Defense
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/1IBEyeJVvxOuamN4ngPtDx)

FACS bring their brooding mix of dissonant and huge sounding hypnotic atmosphere to 2025's "Wish Defense." This is their best showing since "Void Moments" in my opinion. This is a challenging listen, as the arrangements are spacey, sparse, and infinitely dreamy. There is a distinct sense of unease provided to the listener. Bleak vocals and themes, a current of anxiety runs through all of their music. That may sound off-putting at first, but I highly recommend you check this record and this band out if you're not already familiar.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Ordinary Voices
* Desire Path

### Cloakroom - Last Leg of the Human Table
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/71Hy1xx5UXkMPZ6QAZ4SG8)

Modern shoegaze mavens Cloakroom return with another excellent record. This band mixes extremely soft and ethereal vocals with gazey guitars and huge sounding bass riffs. For fans of heavy music without screaming vocals, you'll be right at home here. I doubt they'll ever top "Time Well," but I strongly suspect this record is as close to that as we'll ever get. This band somehow weaves the alt-rock textures of Son Volt or early Wilco with shoegaze and 90s grunge rock. Spacey and dreamy textures throughout and gorgeous vocals all mix together into a lovely album.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* The Pilot
* The Lights Are On

### Miami Horror - We Always Had Tomorrow
[Stream this album](https://album.link/s/0AQL4gTk7w6UdaNqQCz4ih)

A highly anticipated release for me, Aussie indie dance masters Miami Horror return in 2025 with an incredible follow-up nearly a decade after their last proper length LP. I cannot recommend this record enough. This album is wall to wall bangers full of gorgeous synths, soul vocal samples and impossibly good production. A warm hug with the love of your life on the dance floor.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Glowin'
* We're All Made of Stars

I love hearing that I've connected folks with new-to-them music. If you like anything in this list and want more, please reach out to me and let me know. I can recommend lots of similar artists or albums for most of these picks. Let's hope 2026 looks up for everyone.
