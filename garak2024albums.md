## Album write-ups

### Opeth - The Last Will And Testament
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1770619023)

This is probably the biggest surprise for me in 2024, mostly because the last few Opeth albums have.. not been great (TM). They fell head-first into wanky prog a decade ago (and this is coming from a connoisseur of wanky prog) and just never really figured out the formula. It always felt too precious, like a display case filled with things you cannot afford, instead of music. I feel like they finally figured out the formula to mix brutal Swedish death metal and wanky prog together, in a way that actually compliments the two styles perfectly. I wouldn't say this is a return to form, but rather, a new hybrid that I hope they keep going with. I've sorely missed the brutality of Ã…kerfeldt's roar more than I thought I did once I heard this one. This shit is also cover to cover bangers... recommended if you liked earlier Opeth, but not later Opeth.

### The Black Dahlia Murder - Servitude
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1743248165)

I absolutely adore The Black Dahlia Murder, and genuinely would still find a lot to love about any of their albums. This one is particularly bittersweet, as it's the first album after the death of their iconic lead singer and founding member, Trevor Strnad. Trevor killed himself in 2022 after a life-long battle with depression, and I genuinely thought it would be the end of this band. They instead regrouped and put out an extremely respectable TBDM record. It has all the trappings of their classic albums, but is just kind of stuck at 90% for me still. I think the loss of Trevor is obviously the reason, not just his vocals and lyrics, but his influence on the music at large is sorely missed on this release. I am super fucking happy they're sticking together and still going, but I can't help but feel like this one isn't on as heavy rotation as some of their earlier albums have been. Ellis has some killer solos on this album, especially in the taster tracks below.

### Pond - Stung!
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1732063146)

This is a fun, sun-drenched record from Aussie psychedelic stalwarts Pond. There is absolutely no new ground being broken here, but it's a very satisfying summery record that's perfect for having a barbecue and drinking shitty more-water-than-beer in the afternoon sun. While this really isn't anything too revolutionary for them, I think they've drastically improved their vocal harmonies and songwriting prowess. These songs are tight, well constructed, and very fun to jam along to on bass or drums or guitar.

### Kamasi Washington - Fearless Movement
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1729582490)

What an accomplishment this record is. Nearly 90 minutes of beautiful modern jazz music with some interesting collaborations as always. This album actually annoys me on streaming, because the track order is different from the vinyl release. I think this is likely to fit things better on the wax without wasting space, but there is something significantly more cohesive about the vinyl release as a result, and the album just flows better. This is also likely biased, as the vinyl release came to me before it came out on digital, and I wore that shit out for weeks and weeks in that particular track listing. Washington is a masterful songwriter and always finds such beautiful musicians to feature and bring his compositions to life. "Computer Love" dominated my ears for quite a while, and is still a gorgeous and nuanced composition. AndrÃ© 3000 of OutKast fame plays some beautiful flute-like instrument on "Dream State" as well. This is a must-listen of 2024 in my opinion, and a joy to revisit while writing this piece.

### Chat Pile - Cool World
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1750294553)

Oklahoma "anxiety metal" masters Chat Pile return with another aural onslaught with "Cool World." I don't have a better way to describe this band other than their acute ability to cause uneasy feelings and liminal soundscapes, all with brutal Jesus Lizard or Albini style vocal sing/speak stabs. The sound quality is trash, but that's absolutely part of the aesthetic here. These songs are dark, depressing, and full of just the right mix of doom. They have a unique ability to take these caustic ingredients and still build catchy, shoegaze-level zone out vibes. "Masc" is highly recommended, and Chat Pile heads will recognize the running gag they have with variations of this word across most of their album releases. The perfect record to get lost in the middle of nowhere at night with, right off the shitty overpass where your beater of a car broke down for the last time. 

#### ***Taster tracks***
* I Am Dog Now
* Masc
* Shame

### METZ - Up On Gravity Hill
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1724857211)

Canadian noise punk band METZ return in 2024 with a bit of a surprise, at least for me. METZ make a lot of music that all kind of blends together in my brain. That isn't as damning as it sounds, but there generally aren't "bangers" with this band that you remember by name. I tend to think of their albums more abstractly, and this one surprises a bit by being a bit more, dare I say, mainstream in the songwriting style. Quick and comfortably predictable pop sentiments soaked in the disgusting beauty of a dimed Fender Twin barely holding together from the volume. These songs are fun and somewhat more memorable than their albums of late. Do not sleep on "Light Your Way Home" as the perfect example of what I'm describing. These lads are a very fun live show, where the draw is the feeling of the noise between the notes. This band started out being known for their punishingly loud sonics, but have figured out a more atmospheric way of slowing down and having something more nuanced to say.

* Light Your Way Home

### Illiterate Light - Arches
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1756969277)

Illiterate Light are fucking back! I adored this band's first record and following singles and EPs, but their second full-length really left me a bit cold in comparison. Some excellent tracks, but lacking that magic ultimately. Their third full-length "Arches" is a commanding return to form that sticks in your head. They've also elevated their songwriting immensely on this record, including several inspired passages where it hits quite right in the crescendo. "Montauk" and "Black Holes" are incredible tracks that stick in your teeth like taffy. Overall, one of my top records in 2024, despite it only dropping 2 months before the end of it.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Montauk
* Black Holes


### Common Saints - Cinema 3000
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1758060980)

This album is TOO polished, if that's such a thing. As much of a criticism as that sounds, it's actually more of a backhanded compliment. This record perfectly encapsulates the feeling of anemoia, or a longing for a time or a place one has never known themselves. Fauxstalgia. It takes you to a place where this sounds like a soundtrack, but it's not a real place, and serves like cognitive dissonance in a way. You swear you've heard these tunes or melodies before, but they're almost like what an LLM would hallucinate if you asked it to mix a bunch of soul and r&b records from the 1950s-1970s together with a sad sack wanderlust-inflicted protagonist dreaming of being Anywhere But Here (TM). It's a place you feel like you long for, or want to be, but there is a bittersweet side-car to that emotion that none of this is real or authentic. Put this record on, but leave it going once it ends on your streaming service so you can get recommendations for the musicians these guys are trying to cop. ðŸ˜‰

### Sungazer - Against the Fall of Night
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1766305179)

Sungazer are an electrojazz band that sprinkle in random moments of EDM into their tunes. They are very talented musicians that deftly turn complicated polyrhythm laced modern jazz into catchy songs you can actually hum along to. This album has a lot of really great modern jazz music on it, in a very similar vein to bands like Snarky Puppy. They also feature a rotating cast of collaborators that all bring something interesting to the mix. Speaking of Snarky Puppy, long-time guitarist for them, Mark Lettieri, is featured on this album as well. The drums are also really interesting, and sound crisp as fuck on this record.

### The Smile - Cutouts
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1758065392)

The Smile dazzled us in 2024 with two full-length records. This is the second album, and arguably the stronger of the two for my tastes. Radiohead have been one of my top artists for decades so I've been really excited about The Smile since they put their first record out a few years ago. I think with their 2024 releases, this no longer feels as much like a Radiohead side project as much as its own thing now. You always worry with a band made up of musicians from other popular bands, that you end up just getting kind of B-sides level treatment, but they really left no crumbs with these records in my opinion.

#### ***Taster tracks***

* Don't Get Me Started
* Colours Fly

### The Smile - Wall of Eyes
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1711359135)

The Smile dazzled us in 2024 with two full-length records. This is the first album of theirs this year, and has their stand-out track of the year on it. Radiohead have been one of my top artists for decades so I've been really excited about The Smile since they put their first record out a few years ago. I think with their 2024 releases, this no longer feels as much like a Radiohead side project as much as its own thing now. You always worry with a band made up of musicians from other popular bands, that you end up just getting kind of B-sides level treatment, but they really left no crumbs with these records in my opinion. "Teleharmonic" is absolutely gorgeous and immersive. "Bending Hectic" is their best track in 2024 in my opinion, the amount of raw emotion in this tune gives me actual shivers when I listen to it.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Bending Hectic
* Teleharmonic

### REZN - Burden
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1735647431)

Stoner metal band REZN gave us a very solid record in 2024. "Burden" is a really tasty mix of crunchy stoner metal tones mixed with some interesting and controlled atmospheric chaos. Stoner metal has the tendency to get very boring and samey after a while, but they've figured out a good mix of tempos to add some variation to the typical glacial pace of this music, and a healthy dose of delay and reverb to soak their blown out riffs. Overall, a very serviceable record to smoke a multi-gram joint to.


#### ***Taster tracks***
* Bleak Patterns
* Chasm

### Many Eyes - The Light Age
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1759709536)

This one kinda breaks my heart. Legendary metalcore band Every Time I Die broke up in 2022, much to the disappointment of everyone. In the wake of that band, two bands sprung up... one with just the lead singer, and the other with all the rest of the band, minus the singer. The wild thing is that everyone kinda thought the band with 3/4ths of the original band would have made the better record in 2024... but you'd be wrong (in my subjective opinion) Many Eyes is Keith Buckley's new band with the majority of Toxic Holocaust, an excellent thrash metal band, and I think this record is infinitely better than the Better Lovers record, this being the new band with the majority of ETID in it. This album isn't incredible, but it's the closest thing to a new ETDI record we'll likely ever get, and I am happy for that alone.

### King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard - Flight b741
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1751825129)

This album is honestly just pure fucking joy from cover to cover. It's a love letter to bands like The Band, Rolling Stones, etc, KGATLW's unique take on the Americana and rhythm and blues genres. This band is too difficult to explain in a writeup like this, but needless to say they are prolific and try tons of different genres out all the time, this is their 26th full-length studio album. Every song fucking rocks, that's basically the full writeup. Go listen to it immediately! If you have the means to see this Aussie powerhouse live, do not hesitate.

### Tycho - Infinite Health
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1752196202)

I almost didn't include this record, but I feel like Tycho brought back some of their earlier magic with this record, and it's worth checking out, if not just for the first half. This feels more like a return to "Epoch" era Tycho. Full of beautiful and lush synths, this is a very relaxing and chill record to put on in the background while you need to get some work done. Nothing groundbreaking here, but sometimes you just want a scoop of vanilla every now and then. The synths on "Phantom" in particular are delicious.

* Restraint
* Consciousness Felt

### BADBADNOTGOOD - Mid Spiral: Growth
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1745103690)

Jazz instrumentalist masters BADBADNOTGOOD dropped several new albums in 2024... like 3 EPs worth of material that eventually got concatenated into one big album with 3 records. I think they're all pretty good, but this in particular stood out as the best of the bunch. This ultimately ends up being "disc 3" in the larger record, but I've linked the EP specifically here. This is just chock full of gorgeous instrumental jazz with an eye to electro and hip-hop rhythm styles. These lads can do no wrong, and this EP really just feels like a perfect Saturday morning coffee record.

#### ***Taster tracks***
* White Light
* Ways of Seeing

### DIIV - Frog In Boiling Water
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1727618046)

Shoegaze legends DIIV return in 2024 with a very, very solid effort. This feels heavier than their previous records, and more of a return to the "Is the Is Are" era of this band. Tasty, blissed out gazey riffs punctuated by the constant 8th notes of a giant ride cymbal cover every inch of this record. The vocal harmonies are sweet sounding and there's just enough polish on this production to nod to other shoegaze stalwarts like Slowdive. Great drum and guitar tones throughout. 

#### ***Taster tracks***
* Frog In Boiling Water
* Raining On Your Pillow
* Soul-net

### Mannequin Pussy - I Got Heaven
[Stream this album](https://album.link/us/i/1708265210)

This is a really solid gazey punk album with great, versatile vocals. It spans a lot of genres and styles, despite being definitively an indie record. Walls of fuzzy guitars are accentuated by vocals ranging from soft and papery to raucous screams and talk-singing. This feels more like a sampler album than a fully cohesive singular vision, but I enjoyed all the tastes on display. I think there's something for everyone to like on here, even if you normally don't listen to noisy music. 

#### ***Taster tracks***
* I Got Heaven
* I Don't Know You
* Sometimes

## Closing
I hope you've enjoyed this list. I always really appreciate feedback on anything here, especially if you listen to something and really like it. I love hearing that I've connected folks with new-to-them music. If you like anything in this list and want more, please reach out to me and let me know. I can recommend lots of similar artists or albums for most of these picks. Let's hope 2025 looks up for everyone. I said that same thing about 2024, and it was a fucking awful year from top to bottom. 2024 is the year that everything came apart, and I am left with a pile of pieces I'm not even sure go back together anymore. ðŸ¥´

2025 better step its pussy up, we're not doing a repeat.
