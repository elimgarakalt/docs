I don't know what I expect to happen by writing this all out except maybe to vent some poison out of my system. I don't think these problems have actual solutions, and ultimately I have a distinct fear that by raising these issues, I'm only going to make someone else in a vulnerable place feel as rough as I do now. I would put a general disclaimer here that if you are sensitive to issues related to body image, body dysmorphia, commentary on friendships gone south, feelings of inferiority or worthlessness, or just generally feel like your day would be ruined by reading some straight-up awful hopelessness in word-vomit form, please just close this and pretend you never saw it. There is nothing you can specifically do anyway.

A significant portion of this story revolves around understanding and dealing with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) as an adult, anxiety, and low self-image.

Ever since I was young, I knew that I was very different than my peers. I knew about autism, but it was painted very differently when I was younger, and a lot of the signs of it that someone could have detected in me, were explained away as something else or misdiagnosed. I was diagnosed with Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (OCD) in my youth, and I definitely have those tendencies, but that evolved over time and many of those tendencies have gone away or become a non-intrusive part of my life.

I've always struggled with relationships, but not in the way you might think. I am actually always surrounded by people, I have lots of "friends" on paper, and I am generally the life of the party in social situations. Even having said that, I feel utterly and completely alone, and always have. Alone together. Together alone. I can be in a room of 30 people who are interested in talking with me and interacting on a routine basis, but for the vast majority of these relationships, they are empty. Hollow. I call them Diet Coke relationships. Technically it's a fizzy drink that's enjoyable from time to time, but it doesn't really taste the same as the genuine formula. I consider my amount of Coca Cola friends to be an extremely limited set of people, to continue with this terrible metaphor. When I have a close friend, I truly mean close. If you somehow make it to through the battle-hardened, cynical fucking nightmare of an external barrier that I've had to build up for survival reasons, then you are a "I will help you bury a body without asking questions" kind of friend. The contact is intense, deep, meaningful. It *STARTS* as frequent, two-way communication. We will spend a lot of time together. I will neglect other people in my life who maybe on paper should take priority, simply to spend time with you.

I'm going to pause and make a distinction here using a tired, but useful metaphor from my therapist. Successful, healthy relationships involve two-way trust, communication, and respect. She likes to use the "bank machine" metaphor. An ATM. In order for things to work out long-term, and be healthy, you need to try to keep an equal amount of deposits to withdrawals from any social interaction with a person. You've probably run into narcissists in your life if you're of a certain age. You know the type, even though narcissism can take many forms. Ultimately there is a dynamic of a person who is so self-absorbed and fiercely sure they are incapable of any wrong-doing, that they make constant withdrawals from you and never leave genuine deposits. It might be difficult at first to detect this even, narcissists are extremely good at stringing you along with their own learned survival mechanisms. They create just enough plausible deniability for their behavior and actions to make you second-guess yourself, and believe that maybe this person is trying to change and become a better person, but they just need a bit more understanding, a bit more compassion and support, and they'll eventually be able to get to stage 2. They don't fully understand themselves yet and are working through it. There is also a dynamic at play here that narcissists seek out empathetic and vulnerable people. People who are already used to making excuses for their friends and loved ones. People who will tolerate being gaslit over and over. Regardless, if you have the personality type that I do, I am a fucking magnet for this type of situation. I think this is the case because I am extremely empathetic. I am a kind person. I try to find the good in everyone and put a spotlight on it. I actively care about people on a deep level, even my Diet Coke friends. I will go out of my way to give of myself at my own literal detriment. This is where I usually run into problems, and not just with narcissists.

There is a reason I am kind though. I am naturally this way, but I've also been on the receiving end of what I can only call unspeakable cruelty, abuse, neglect, and physical assault.  I know first hand what it feels like to be mistreated by life, and it has pushed me so far into a place of spending my own time and capital on making sure the people in my life that I care about never have to understand those things. They never have to know what it feels like. A friend here said, you can always tell the people who are the most kind and genuinely good people, usually have some kind of dark past or trauma that has made them this way. I think I agree with that in most cases. It sounds super fucking self-absorbed to outright call myself a genuinely good and kind person, but I am learning through this process to stand up for myself more and say things that I think are objectively true, even if they feel boastful.

This kindness is a magnet for damaged, one-sided, difficult relationships for me. It is a dynamic that I have tried everything I can possibly think of to avoid starting over and over again, and yet I always find myself back in the same place. When things *always* go a specific way for you, after some point, you have to acknowledge to yourself that maybe *I* am the problem here. It becomes impossible to ignore. It becomes statistically improbable, to deny that you are the source of the problem. But I think the difficult thing for me to grasp, and something I am slowly learning about myself and my ASD, is that *who I am* is the problem. It is not something I can work on and improve in the same way that someone can work on stopping a habit like smoking tobacco. It is not something that I can workshop forever and increment progress on in the same way. That isn't to say I cannot work on myself and my mental health(I do!), and work with therapists who can help me navigate this disorder. But it does mean that I cannot wake up tomorrow and not be autistic. I cannot wake up as a different race. There is no button to press or side-quest to start that will eventually let me grind hard enough to change who I am, at this fundamental level. So when I say I am the problem, I'm half right.. I am the incompatible one. I am the one who will never, and *can* never integrate into the society and world that most neurotypical people can. It means that no matter what, I will perceive, experience, and act in this world in a way that is fundamentally not compatible with the status quo. The *real* problem to me, is a world that is not capable of trying to understand that not everything has a fucking script, not everything follows a recipe or formula, and not everything can be neatly labeled and filed away in a cabinet. Real life is fucking messy, and if you are in the select group of privileged people (white, male, neurotypical), you genuinely have never had to understand or care that an entire massive world exists outside your tiny microcosm. Don't mistake me, I am never going to give that a pass, and the effort and work is 1000000% absolutely on those people to do better and be better. That said, I am explaining the dynamic that many people face, where if you go off the beaten path, you are less-than. You are not worth the effort to be able to understand for these people. You are difficult, awkward, weird. I see unique, I see beautiful, I see variation and a beautiful palette of shades of grey between everything. They see an inconvenience. A threat. A distraction from whatever their affairs are. It sounds cliche to say "can't we just all find common ground?" but in reality that's the only way anything ever changes. If people bother to understand why things hit me differently, and care enough about me as a person to really understand and work with that, just as I have to constantly, 24/7 work around not fitting into a world that was never made for me, then we have an equal trade.

I am only just beginning to understand myself and how I fit into the autism spectrum. I am not trying to be this person that is trying to write some deeply philosophical document and come up with some profound conclusions based on something I only just have begun to understand fully. But nonetheless, I am going to spill my voice out into the void either way, because I don't know what else to do. Frankly if you're still reading this, I imagine I have your eyeballs for the remainder of this document, and if not, well.. see above. So preamble #20 aside, I am going to talk about how I experience the world for a bit.

I have become a pro at masking, from before I even understood what that term was. I used to describe it more naively as being a chameleon. I am able to become whatever is needed in the moment, like a super power. If someone is sad, I am morphed immediately into a supportive friend who can help someone talk through it. If I'm in a group of people who cannot make a decision, I speak up and become very assertive and confident. Other times I am the clown, the one who will make the uncomfortable phone call to the billing dept for you because it gives you anxiety. I can be anything I need to be and I do it all automatically. But the cost of this is that it's not *actually me*. I feel like I am method acting a role. I learned very early on that I would need to be able to have my own bag of tricks in order to integrate with the world. I now understand this dynamic with a lot more clarity since I've been reading and understanding what ASD is and can be. I've also learned how to weaponize it to my advantage. The massive downside to all the masking is of course, I am not honestly sure what is real and what isn't, who I actually am in a lot of cases. I've been playing this character for so long that sometimes I have to consider whether something actually happened to me, or if it's the mask.

I can't really get into what I do too much on here because this is still an alt after all, but it's not really that much of a secret to tell you that I work with deeply technical computer stuff, and I've used my unique view on the world, due to my ASD, to develop an extremely lucrative and successful career. I see problems differently. I think about things others may not. I understand and see things in a different light than a typical person might. That has made me exceptionally good at solving problems others cannot. It has made me who I am. I am a problem solver, and I find joy in the details. I will relentlessly grind something for hours, days, weeks, until it works like I want it to. I will take things apart and understand them and I will use this to make things better for the world. That's as much as I'll say on that. But it's important to understand that this is a way I've been successful at taking the cards I was dealt and somehow finding a way to make it work for myself. I don't give up easily. I don't accept defeat easily, and I am relentless to the point of my own detriment at times. I don't know when to let some things go. I don't know when to give people space, or when to stop typing about something I am very passionate about (lol)
. I don't know that sometimes I am being *"too much (TM)*," and it has real consequences for my personal life. It impacts all of my friendships and relationships to a very deep extent.

There's a quote I used to tell my therapist, from the first *Terminator* film. It sounds bleak, grim, or dark. I've used it to describe what depression feels like, but more so, I've used it to describe myself.

```"Kyle Reese : Listen, and understand! That Terminator is out there! It can't be bargained with. It can't be reasoned with. It doesn't feel pity, or remorse, or fear. And it absolutely will not stop... ever, until you are dead!"```

This is how things feel in my brain a lot of times. I have become exceptional at masking it, controlling it, stopping it from ruining my relationships, but to some extent... I have a 90% control over it. When I set my mind to something, I am a relentless fucking machine that cannot be stopped. It scares me a lot, but I've never used it to cause intentional harm to anyone, and ultimately, I've improved the lives of millions of people (not hyperbolic) because of it. This is the curse of duality. It is my biggest strength and my biggest weakness in one. But it comes at a massive cost.

I get into trouble though, when I look at my Coca Cola friends. These friendships always seem to go the same way. They are intense, fiercely fulfilling, rewarding, passionate. At least at the start. Over time, relationships change and people change. That's normal, that's natural. It happens. What happens to my relationships is not that though. It's something different, something harder to put my finger on. I am hyper-aware of my relationship status with my Coca Cola friends, and I am extremely sensitive to even the slightest whiff that the dynamic has changed. I tend to panic and worry that I've done something wrong again, that I said too much, that I did too much. That I didn't do enough, that I wasn't enough. That I'll never be good enough. I tend to try to fix it, and in turn, create a hyper-correction that in a lot of cases pushes the person I so desperately want to hold onto further away. It's like trying to hold onto sand. This ruins friendships, because people think I am being obsessive or unreasonable. I understand that. Maybe I am? Maybe I just want for these relationships to last and become something life-long.  ASD folks don't do well with things changing out from under them. I crave order, structure. I need to understand how I stand to feel myself, to feel open enough to be confident and organic and relaxed. When the dynamic changes, so do I. I find myself being told to put my mask back on, in so many words. It ruins my ability to trust the person, and it destroys my safety net. I no longer feel safe sharing things with this person. The longer the rift goes on, the more bitter and disconnected I become. At some point, all is lost, regardless of the other party.

But I think the more sinister part of this, and the one that's fucking me up the most, is that most people are just not good at relationships. Most people are exceptionally selfish. Most people only care about how they feel. They don't like to give and only want to take. I get into a mode where the friendship will just dry up and die off unless I specifically do mental and physical effort. People stop texting you, they stop reaching out to you to talk about things. They never reach out to make plans with you, you have to do that. If I want to see some of my friends, it will literally never fucking happen unless I am the one who does the work. And fam, I am so *fucking tired* of being the only one willing to do that work. I am so fucking fed up with being the only one who puts any fucking effort into it. I used to think people are inherently good and care for their fellow person, but the older I get, and seeing things like the response to covid19, I don't think that anymore. It's not true. I have been pushed into a place mentally that makes me assume the worst in people, because the worst in people is all I've ever been afforded the luxury of experiencing. I used to think, maybe these are just the friendships you make and seek out. That's probably true, I am stuck in a specific dynamic, and as mentioned earlier, I am a magnet for one-sided people. I held out for so long just thinking, maybe I will meet the right person, maybe I will find my ride or die friends finally, but that never comes, and frankly, I am at a place where I don't genuinely feel like it's possible to have healthy, long-term relationships with most NT people. They just cannot understand, are unwilling to understand, or frankly just don't care enough to break that dynamic.

What you have to understand, NT readers, is that when the relationship changes, my safety net is obliterated. My ability to feel comfortable in my own skin goes out the window. Everything becomes an analytical nightmare of scrutinizing every possible outcome that could have lead us here. Everything becomes measured, and it becomes hopeless. I eventually just stop talking to people, and sure enough, those people never reach out again. They simply don't care. The most infuriating shit I can receive from any person is literally the phrase "hey I haven't heard from you in a while, why haven't you reached out?" Motherfucker. Phones work in two directions, if you haven't heard from me in a while, maybe it's because I'm super fucking tired of screaming into the void, hoping for a deeper connection. Maybe it's because I'm tired of being the only one putting in the effort. Maybe it's because you don't engage with me anymore, and yet, you still expect the onus to be on me for that and try to make me feel like I'm fucking up. I absolutely do not tolerate this anymore, and usually it's the final push I need to cut someone out. I don't think NT people can possibly understand how high the stakes feel to a ND person when it comes to close relationships. They don't seem to matter as much to them. Most people are ok with just having casual friends, but I am not that kind of person. I want to feel a deeper bond than someone you talk to twice a year. Why bother otherwise?

Here's the cut-to-the-chase moment of this pointless fucking rant into the void. Am I just not worthy of respect, love, care? Am I not worthy of attention, affection? Am I just some means to an end? I struggle so hard to understand what I could do differently, I struggle to understand how things could ever have ended up any place else, and I never get an answer. When you do this to me, you make me feel fucking worthless. You make me feel like maybe I did deserve to get thrown down the stairs by a loved one because I'm just some annoying, overbearing, useless waste of space. Or assaulted by a lover. Or worse I can't even fucking type out here right now. You make me feel like I deserve to be alone, without love. And then I believe it.. what else could you do? What other conclusion can you come up with, if every meaningful relationship in your life ends in the exact same fucking groundhog day nightmare? The problem has to be me, right? If today I decided to just never message anyone in my life again, I can only think of maybe one or two people I would hear from eventually, and it would be likely because they need something from me. That isn't an existence, it's just servitude.

When you stop reaching out to me, when you stop engaging, and then gaslight me into thinking that's somehow my fault, you cross a line that cannot be undone. Or worse, you double, triple down on reassuring me that everything is fine, but then you change nothing about your actual behavior. You become just another person that used me up and threw me in the fucking garbage. It's Garbage Day, toss Garak in the bin once you've extracted everything you can from him. I feel perpetually in a role where I find someone in need, I help mend their wings, and then they fly away.... but I'm still here, alone. Why am I so forgettable? Why don't I deserve these things? What can I possibly do differently? I think there's some element of people feeling sorry for me and being unwilling to sack up and just tell me that they'd rather spend less time with me. They just ghost you, hope you forget about them. Most don't want to create any awkward situations, and hope these things just fade away. I am not given the respect of like, hey we went different directions, and that's ok. I am left to wonder and torment myself on all the ways that I must have ruined yet another close friendship. I think about how maybe this is my nature, to seek out the wounded, nurse them back to health. Maybe it's because I think in return for the privilege, they'll treat me better, that they'll actually care about me and want to spend time with me. Maybe if I just help this person enough, they'll feel seen and loved and do the same in return. But the people I seem to gravitate towards, or rather, them to me, they never do that. They never *will* do that. It is a toxic dynamic, but it's the only dynamic in which I get a glimpse of what it would feel like to be important and loved and special. It's hard to let go of something like that, even if it's more bad than good for you.

I genuinely feel like most people in my life have wanted me around because of what I am able to do for them. Sometimes it's money, I freely help support people I can because I remember growing up with very little and thinking about how amazing getting a random $100 USD would feel. It would have changed my life. I want to use my life to change others' lives for the better, but I don't get shown that same courtesy in return. Sometimes it's knowledge, oh you are really smart you can help me fix this thing, or you can come pick me up from fuck knows where. Maybe I can help you with a relationship problem, or your depression, or your own body issues. Maybe I can help you get back on your feet. But once I've given everything I can, and there's nothing left, the only logical next move seems to be to just throw me away. It's always Garbage Day in the hellscape that is my brain. Every bin on the block says Garak on it.

I don't think I can describe in words what it feels like in my head once I realize the point of no return has been reached, and the messages stop coming or it starts to get very one-sided. The "how's the weather" banter. The once a week message that's not even worth receiving. Constantly being left on read, when I try to reach out more. The deposits stop coming, if they even began at all. It feels like 300000000 screaming, flaming skulls flying through my brain in surround sound. It is a relentless, punishing cacophony that shuts me down and pushes me further into the hole. Realizing you've been unfriended. Realizing you've been hellmuted, or blocked. Realizing you've lost access to someone who could, and wanted to, solve your riddles, and did, but then chose not to anymore, without any real reason given.

Having to even start/have a conversation about how things have changed in your friends dynamic with an NT person, is like burning one more little rope on the bridge holding you together. The bridge is thread bare, rickety, falling apart by the end, and each time you try to measure or discuss this in a way that can provide you some ounce of mental relief, you end up torching another tie that binds you. You make the bridge just that much more dangerous to try to cross again. Sometimes you just torch the entire thing in one go, but that's more rare. Usually it's thousands of micro-aggressions that build up into something worse. You try to explain to them, please do me the kindness of just being real with me on this topic. It's still going to suck to lose this person, but at least I understand that a door is closing. It's explicit. I can work with that. What I cannot work with is being told over and over that nothing is wrong, and then acting in a way that's completely counter to that sentiment. It makes you question things like.. oh this person needs space for some reason (that I don't understand fully), but I have love and care for them, so I will give them that space. Surely it will improve. But then it never does. The distance just grows. It makes you calculate every interaction with them. Should I message? It's been 13 days now... that seems like enough right? when in reality, when things were normal between you, I'd have no problem sending 12 messages in a row whenever I fucking felt like it, because I could unmask and trust this person. Because I was allowed to be the real me. But not anymore.. now it's like, hmm should I interact with this post or not? I don't want to come off as "too much". It creates this entire system of behavior that is not who I want to be, nor how I ever feel comfortable, but yet the rules of the game have changed on me literally through no fault of my own most times. If I am to believe people who answer me on "was it something I said or didn't? was it something I did or didn't do?" that is. If you are still reading this document and you identify as an NT person. Please take one thing from this document. Please understand that some of your ND friends are HARD WIRED differently than you are, and everything you take for granted or don't think too hard about all matter extensively more to that person than they ever will to you. Please understand that if you act like I described in this document, you are literally, actively harming an ND person on the receiving end of this. Most will never tell you this, because they know it will just make things worse. It will be throwing gasoline on the fire you're so desperately trying to find a way to extinguish. But I will tell you, faceless stranger, since we're not in any kind of close relationship most likely. This fucking sucks and you need to do better for your ND friends. If you care about them even a little bit, please check in with them and be explicit. If a long absence has happened, please explain to whatever degree of detail you feel comfortable with how it was just difficult and had nothing to do with that person. Check in with them and make them feel seen and loved. You have no idea how many days I sat in a pool of my own tears or just stared out the window into nothing or got too high or drunk on purpose just to feel something else, could have been avoided with a single text message.

I am a German power plug, and the world is an Australian shaped power outlet. I am never, ever going to plug into it and get power from it. I am never going to be enough. I will never be X enough, I will never be Y enough, Z enough. I am trying to keep away from the flames as much as I can, but at some point, unless things radically change, I cannot imagine not reaching a place where the terror of the fall loses out here short of completely escaping this current place in my life and starting over in a new country, with new people, in a place where no one knows me, with a different job, and a different life.

I talk a lot about being a black swan to folks who I trust enough to talk to them about stuff like this, the problem with that analogy is that at the end of the story, the ugly duckling figures out it's not a duck after all, and finds its people. I have never found my people. I have never felt part of any community I've ever been in. I'm a musician, an insufferable computer person, a video game enjoyer, a terminally online shitposter, I am into kink, I am gay/queer, and yet... I've never felt like I belong in any of these communities. As welcome as woof.group has made me feel, I just genuinely don't feel like I am part of something on mastodon as a whole. Woof folks have made me feel extremely welcome and liked, but there's a barrier I cannot describe on my side that prevents me from feeling like I belong here fully. I feel like all my hobbies and interests create these spaces where I see people thrive, build a sense of community. I just don't feel it and I don't know why or how to fix that. I want to feel part of something, and really feel it. I want to feel like people are really happy that I turned up. Norm from "Cheers" shit.

So where do I go from here? I would like to hear from other autistic folks with whom this resonates with this and understand what I am talking about. What are your strategies for coping with this? What's worked for you? What *hasn't* worked for you? Not to be rude, but I don't really want replies to this otherwise. I am not looking for sympathy posts or to chat more about these things with anyone otherwise.

I started this account trying to be more authentic, but what I came to realize is that a lot of the people who tell you it's ok to be authentic sometimes really don't like what you have to say, and they write passive-aggressive, self-important screeds about it, distorting the truth and bending the story arc to be about their feelings about the situation they did to themselves to begin with, and subtoot it for attention. That's life, life is messy and we're not always going to agree on things... but it goes beyond disagreement with some folks. I think it's healthy to acknowledge that we don't always have to agree on things, but when your words become fodder for integer grinding from folks, it makes you question whether the people who want you to be authentic actually do, if the response is "not like that!" I know way better than to bargain or argue with narcissists at this point in my life who don't respect boundaries. I feel like a lot of people take any disagreement or difference of opinion as some personal attack or something directed at them, and for my autistic brain, I am simply pointing out how I feel about it in a calm, collected manner... but judging from reading about others in this position and my own experience, people warp and turn that into something it isn't. They try to prescribe a deeper or sinister meaning when in reality I am just telling you how I feel and there's no emotion more than that to it. Wasn't I supposed to be authentic? I suppose "not like that," after all.
